# Quick Start

This is the shortest path to a working install.

## Claude Desktop (macOS)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hetpatel-11/Adobe_Premiere_Pro_MCP.git
cd Adobe_Premiere_Pro_MCP
npm run setup:mac
```

Then do this once inside Premiere Pro:

1. Open `Premiere Pro > Preferences > Plugins` and enable **UXP Plugins > Enable developer mode**.
2. Restart Premiere Pro if the setting was changed.
3. Open `Window > Extensions > MCP Bridge (CEP)`.
4. Leave `Temp Directory` at its default (`~/Library/Application Support/premiere-mcp-bridge`), or set it explicitly if it's blank.
5. Click `Save Configuration`.
6. Click `Start Bridge`.
7. Click `Test Connection`.

Then restart Claude Desktop and ask:

```text
What's my current Premiere Pro project info?
```

For better editing behavior, attach `premiere://config/get_instructions` before asking the model to change a project.

## Codex / Claude Code

Build the server:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Add the MCP entry on one line:

```bash
codex mcp add premiere_pro --env PREMIERE_TEMP_DIR="$HOME/Library/Application Support/premiere-mcp-bridge" -- node /absolute/path/to/Adobe_Premiere_Pro_MCP/dist/index.js
```

Then:

1. Restart the client.
2. Open the Premiere CEP panel.
3. Confirm the temp directory matches `PREMIERE_TEMP_DIR` (default: `~/Library/Application Support/premiere-mcp-bridge`).
4. Click `Start Bridge`.

## Sanity Checks

Run:

```bash
npm run setup:doctor
```

For a real end-to-end verification, use a scratch project and run:

```bash
node scripts/live-tool-sweep.mjs
```

That sweep creates disposable `Sweep ...` sequences so the live bridge is actually exercised.

## Common Failure Cases

### The client sees the MCP server but tool calls fail

- Premiere is not open
- no project is open
- the CEP panel is not started
- the temp directory in the panel does not match `PREMIERE_TEMP_DIR` (default: `~/Library/Application Support/premiere-mcp-bridge`)
- the panel needs a right-click `Reload` after bridge updates

### `codex mcp add` fails

- the command was split across lines
- the path to `dist/index.js` is wrong
- the client was not restarted after config changes

### `setup:doctor` fails

- the CEP extension is not installed
- `dist/index.js` was not built
- Adobe CEP debug mode is disabled
- the Claude Desktop config entry points to the wrong path
